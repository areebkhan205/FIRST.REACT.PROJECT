# 🛠️ First React + Vite Project

This is my very first project built with **React** and **Vite**! 🚀

While working on this, I learned and practiced many basic concepts of React and modern frontend development, such as:
- Setting up a React project with Vite
- Using components and JSX
- Working with CSS and Tailwind for styling
- Making a simple, responsive navbar
- Adding hover effects and basic interactivity

It’s just a small, simple, and responsive project — but it helped me understand and apply many React fundamentals and build confidence for future, bigger projects.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- React
- Vite
- CSS / Tailwind CSS

## ✅ What I learned
- How to set up and run a React project using Vite
- Writing and importing components
- Styling with plain CSS and Tailwind utility classes
- Creating hover effects and making the UI responsive

## ✨ Note
This project is mainly for **practice and learning**. It’s quite simple, but it was a great first step into the React world!
